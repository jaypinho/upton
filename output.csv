            DNA Confirms Body Parts Belong to Boy With Autism

    First there was the disappearance: a 14-year-old boy with autism last seen walking out of his school by the Queens waterfront last fall. Then there were the months of searching, the posters of a fresh-faced teenager that a city came to know simply as Avonte.With the discovery last week of a body in pieces on the shoreline of the East River, and clothes that appeared to match those last worn by the teenager, hopes dimmed that the boy, Avonte Oquendo, would turn up alive. Those days of uncertainty ended Tuesday as the results of DNA testing confirmed what many had feared: Avonte would not be coming home. The city medical examiner’s office said that remains found along the rocks in College Point, Queens, had been matched to DNA samples provided by several members of Avonte’s family on Friday, when the police began gathering pieces of a body and the telltale articles of clothing — a striped shirt, size 5 ½ Air Jordan sneakers — worn by Avonte. “Avonte’s family searched, really searched,” David H. Perecman, a lawyer for Avonte’s relatives, said on Tuesday. “The people of the city of New York searched.”
            
        Posters seeking information about Avonte Oquendo's whereabouts were placed around the city in the fall. Bryan Thomas for The New York TimesIn the days and weeks after Avonte went missing on Oct. 4, the Police Department fanned out, scouring the city by every available means: Divers searched in the waters of the East River; officers went around train stations; bloodhounds were put on possible scents. On the subways, riders saw posters of his face and heard announcements describing the teenager and urging anyone with information to come forward. The city’s efforts were amplified by teams of volunteers mounting an aggressive effort to locate Avonte, who because of severe autism could not speak. They erected a makeshift command center in Long Island City, Queens. Leads came in; none panned out.A chance discovery, by a young woman who first told her mother before they phoned the police, began a grisly process of collecting pieces of a body. That evening, officers cordoned off an area of the riverbank along Powells Cove Boulevard, several miles northeast of Avonte’s school. It was not clear how his body had come to rest there, the police said. 
            
        David H. Perecman, a lawyer for the family of Avonte Oquendo, held a news conference on Tuesday. Karsten Moran for The New York TimesOver the next few days, they gathered a collection of bones, each of which would be tagged separately, placed in a paper evidence bag and eventually tested to confirm its connection to Avonte. Some were as small as fragments, others as large as an arm or a leg. By Tuesday, the police said investigators had collected what was believed to be about 90 percent of the boy’s body. As the police planned more searches on Tuesday, the medical examiner’s office gave grim finality to the hopes of a family and a city that had wondered for months what had happened to the boy on the posters. The medical examiner’s office said a cause of death had yet to be determined. Forensic experts said it was not common for bodies found in the water to be so severely dismembered. The police said that the investigation into his death would continue, directed by the new insights provided by a study of the remains.“The big finding is going to be if they come up with a cause of death,” said Stephen Davis, the Police Department’s top spokesman. “And that is a big ‘if’ in a case like this, where the body is in the water for so long.” He added that investigators were working on the premise that the body had been in the water “virtually from Day 1.”Last year, Avonte’s family began the process of suing the city over his disappearance, casting blame on the city, the Education Department and the Riverview School on 51st Avenue, where video captured Avonte leaving.

    BRUSSELS — Even as Russia imposes the most intensive security apparatus in Olympic history, the top military officers from the United States and Russia have opened discussions about using sophisticated American electronic equipment in a new effort to help secure the Winter Games in Sochi next month.The Russian delegation first raised the prospect of gaining access to the American technology, developed by the Pentagon to counter improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq, Defense Department officials said on Tuesday. They emphasized that no decisions had been made yet.The potential for a technological exchange was part of an extensive discussion here on Tuesday, when Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held his first face-to-face meeting with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, chief of the general staff.President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also discussed security at the Games in a phone conversation on Tuesday, Reuters reported. 
            
        Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov of Russia. RIA Novosti, via ReutersFew details were disclosed. General Dempsey said the Defense Department would be willing to provide equipment designed to detect and disrupt cellphone or radio signals used by militants to detonate improvised explosives from a distance. But he cautioned that technical experts from both nations first needed to make sure that the American systems could be integrated into the communications networks and security systems being set in place by Russia.In discussing the Pentagon’s technology to counter improvised explosives, General Dempsey noted that this was “something that we’ve become extraordinarily familiar with.” Homemade bombs planted by militants have been the leading cause of deaths and injuries to American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq.But the decision on whether to share the equipment is not a simple one. Especially during the early use of the technology, the American military found that it had created a muddle of electronic signals in which competing and overlapping systems canceled out the effectiveness of other systems in use at the same time and in the same area.“If you’re not careful, you can actually degrade capability, not enhance it,” General Dempsey said.During their meetings here, the American and Russian military chiefs sought to advance an agenda of exchanges and continued cooperation on counterterrorism and antipiracy operations, despite the fact that diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow swing between caustic disagreement and cautious cooperation.Even with their extensive agenda on bilateral security issues, the question of safety at the Olympics was thoroughly discussed, including a description by General Gerasimov of the close cooperation between the Russian military and its civilian law enforcement and intelligence services to provide security for the Games.General Gerasimov described in detail how Russian authorities “have in place the intelligence apparatus as well as the response apparatus to deal with the threats,” General Dempsey said. Generals Dempsey and Gerasimov met one day after Pentagon officials disclosed that the United States European Command was drawing up plans to have two Navy warships in the Black Sea at the time of the Games, should they be needed in case of emergency.In addition to deploying tens of thousands of police officers and military reinforcements to the Sochi area, the Russian government has tightened control inside the city ahead of the opening of the Games on Feb. 7, banning vehicles that are not registered in the region and requiring even Russians who visit to register with the police within three days, as foreigners must do. The threat of terrorism has become a grim reality of major sporting events, and Russian officials are acutely aware that these Games are being held near a region festering with Islamist separatists. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Both the American and Russian generals — who share a history of having commanded large tank and armored units — emphasized the importance of improving communication between their armed forces.“I think we have an opportunity to advance the relationship on areas of common interest,” General Dempsey said.He noted in particular that Moscow remains a vital partner for supply lines for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, agreeing to allow the movement of nonlethal material to and from the war zone through Russian territory; that rail and road network is becoming increasingly important as protests in Pakistan choke efforts to use the more convenient supply line there.General Dempsey said his Russian counterpart was concerned about the potential for further instability in Afghanistan after the NATO combat mission there officially ends this year. General Gerasimov has asked for updates on the American and NATO effort to train, advise and equip Afghan National Security Forces, General Dempsey said, as well as Afghanistan’s ability to maintain and control transportation lines in and out of the country.“He is absolutely concerned, as I would be in his place,” General Dempsey said.In brief remarks welcoming General Dempsey to the Russian mission to NATO in suburban Brussels, General Gerasimov endorsed “regular contacts” between the militaries as “quite useful.” General Dempsey, in an interview, said it was important for the two militaries “not to foreclose on conversations, even if at some points there are disagreements that prevent the forward movement” in other parts of the relationship, whether political or diplomatic.

            In Files, a History of Sexual Abuse by Priests in Chicago Archdiocese

    CHICAGO — One priest, the Rev. William J. Cloutier, was accused of raping a boy in his summer cottage, locking the door when the 13-year-old started screaming, and then brandishing a handgun while threatening to kill him if he told anyone. Another, the Rev. Robert C. Becker, would take boys to a trailer where, they said, he slept with them and molested them. And the Rev. Joseph R. Bennett was accused of raping a girl with the handle of a paten, a plate designed to hold eucharistic bread.Thousands of documents gleaned from the personnel files of the Archdiocese of Chicago were released to the public on Tuesday, unspooling a lurid history of abuse by priests and halting responses from bishops in the country’s third-largest archdiocese. In each case, the priests ultimately died or were ousted from ministry, and in most cases, the allegations were never proved in a criminal court. But the documents suggest that church officials were at times quite solicitous toward priests accused of abuse.

In one remarkable instance in 1997, Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin was persuaded to allow the body of an abusive priest’s mother to be brought to the prison where the priest, the Rev. Norbert J. Maday, was incarcerated so he could pay his respects. Cardinal Francis E. George, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Chicago, described the accommodation in a thank-you note as “an exceptional act of charity.”Cardinal George’s predecessor, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin, opted not to defrock the same priest, writing a letter to him in prison declaring that “you have suffered enough by your present deprivation of ministry and your incarceration.”On Tuesday, shortly after the documents were posted online, the Archdiocese of Chicago published on its website a statement again apologizing for abuse by priests and declaring, “the Archdiocese acknowledges that its leaders made some decisions decades ago that are now difficult to justify.”“We realize the information included in these documents is upsetting,” the statement said. “It is painful to read. It is not the Church we know or the Church we want to be.”A few hours later, abuse victims and their lawyers gathered in the 23rd-floor ballroom of a downtown hotel, lined up in front of posters and a video screen displaying photographs of priests accused of abusing minors. At the side of a lectern sat three cardboard boxes filled with copies of the files.Jeff Anderson, a lawyer who has represented numerous victims of clergy sexual abuse around the nation, said the documents depicted a “systematic, ongoing, decades-long, continuous pattern of conscious choices by top officials of the archdiocese,” and argued that church officials were complicit in the abuse when they failed to remove abusers from ministry.“The priorities have been demonstrated to have been the protection of the offenders and the reputation of the archdiocese,” he said. Later, turning to the victims beside him, he said, “These children were not as important to them as the clergy were.”Most of the abuse described in the documents was alleged to have taken place years ago; about half of the accused priests are dead, and many of the victims have already been given financial settlements from the archdiocese. Some of the documents have previously been available online, and have received attention in local news reports, as a result of criminal prosecutions and civil suits.But the victims have pressed for public release of the files, arguing that the comprehensive set of documents will provide an important form of reckoning, chronicling what church officials did, and did not do, when they learned of accusations that priests had molested minors.

 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “For some of us it will be answers, for some of us it will be peace of mind, for some of us it’s wanting to know, but for all of us it’s a start,” said Angel Santiago, 47, who won a $700,000 settlement from the archdiocese in 2011 after accusing the Rev. Joseph L. Fitzharris of abusing him in the early 1980s. “It’s a little more weight off my shoulders,” he said, “but I still carry some of it.”Father Fitzharris, who acknowledged abusing multiple boys, was defrocked in 2009. Father Cloutier, whose threats with the gun were investigated but not prosecuted by the local police in 1979, went on to face further accusations of abuse; he resigned from the priesthood in 1993 and died in 2003. Father Becker, who in 1986 wrote in a letter to Cardinal Bernardin about “how full of shame I feel for having betrayed you and the archdiocese,” died in 1989. Father Bennett, who denied most of the many accusations against him, resigned from the priesthood in 2012.The personnel files of accused priests have previously been made public in other American dioceses, including Boston and Los Angeles, generally as a result of litigation. Most of the documents have been published in an online archive, BishopAccountability.org.The Archdiocese of Chicago has paid about $100 million to settle abuse allegations against priests. The archdiocese has also posted to its website a list of 65 priests — none still in ministry — who the church said have been credibly accused of abusing minors; the documents released Tuesday concern 30 priests whose files were subject to negotiations with victims’ lawyers.A lawyer for the accused priests, Joseph V. Roddy, said the documents’ accusations should be read with caution, because “some were tested in criminal court, but in the vast majority of cases, they’re just allegations.”An archdiocesan lawyer told reporters last week that 95 percent of the allegations in the files concerned conduct before 1988, and none after 1996; 14 of the 30 accused priests are dead, and none are still serving in ministry. Cardinal George, who has been the archbishop of Chicago since 1997, has said he never met many of the priests.The release of the Chicago files comes as Cardinal George, a 77-year-old cancer survivor and one of the leading intellectuals in the American church hierarchy, is awaiting permission from the Vatican to retire. Pope Francis’ choice of a new archbishop of Chicago will be closely watched as it will probably be the pope’s first appointment to lead a major American see.Although the abuse described in the documents took place before Cardinal George became archbishop, many of the victims first came forward after his arrival; some of the files concern cases in which Cardinal George’s response has been questioned, including that of the Father Bennett, whose disciplinary proceeding the cardinal briefly delayed, and Father Maday, whose prison sentence the cardinal sought to reduce.“It would be a great fulfillment of the millennium spirit to see your captive heart set free,” Cardinal George wrote to the incarcerated Father Maday in 2000. But the cardinal later changed his mind. In 2007, after several more people had come forward to say they had been abused by Father Maday, the cardinal wrote to a parole commission, saying he was seeking to defrock the priest.The documents also shed new light on the handling of abusers by Cardinal Bernardin, a highly regarded figure in American Catholic history, and one of the first prominent church figures to act strongly against clergy sexual abuse by naming a board in 1992 to investigate future accusations. Cardinal Bernardin had occasionally given abusive priests second chances — for example, he allowed Father Fitzharris a new parish assignment, with the caveat that he should not be allowed unsupervised contact with high-school-age boys, after the priest had been criminally charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old.

            After Stumbling Badly, Dow Jones Chief Resigns

        Lex Fenwick had tried to unify a number of Dow Jones products in the nearly two years he served as chief executive. Brendan McDermid/Reuters
            
            
                    
    

        

        
    Lex Fenwick, the hard-driving chief executive who stumbled in his efforts to transform Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has resigned effective immediately as the company rethinks its strategy. The resignation was announced on Tuesday by Dow Jones’s parent company, News Corporation, which is controlled by the billionaire Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Fenwick’s departure came after News Corporation’s leadership decided that the Dow Jones division needed to change direction, said a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity.News Corporation’s chief executive, Robert Thomson, said he felt that the company, which was spun off from Mr. Murdoch’s more profitable film and television businesses, needed to offer more flexibility to customers, and was keen to change course quickly. Mr. Fenwick’s plan had been to unify a number of Dow Jones products — offering a fast-moving news wire along with other financial databases — and charge customers one price for them all. The new venture, called DJX, was seen by many inside the company as a misstep, said two people, because the high-priced product offered little choice and was unpopular. Numerous customers blanched at the price increases, and many complained that the product was inferior to the data terminals offered by Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. “We’re reviewing the institutional strategy of Dow Jones with an eye toward changes that will deliver even more value to its customers,” Mr. Thomson said. “As part of that, we’re planning improvements to DJX.”Mr. Fenwick, who once ran Bloomberg L.P., was with the company for less than two years. He was rumored to have set up a boxing ring in Bloomberg’s London offices to energize the sales staff. An internal company newsletter from last year described him as “The Lex-ionnaire” and pictured him, head shaved clean, wearing his trademark tailored purple suit. He will be replaced on a temporary basis by William Lewis, News Corporation’s chief creative officer and a former editor in chief of Britain’s Telegraph newspaper group, the statement said. Mr. Lewis helped oversee News Corporation’s response to a British investigation of the phone hacking scandal in 2011. Current and former executives who worked with Mr. Fenwick say he has a history as a gifted salesman with a record of expanding businesses. But they have also described him as a brash and demanding boss.Nearly a dozen senior executives left the company during Mr. Fenwick’s tenure, according to a study published by the analyst Ken Doctor at Harvard’s Nieman Journalism lab. Mr. Fenwick succeeded Les Hinton, who had been at Mr. Murdoch’s side for more than five decades when he stepped down in the face of the phone hacking controversy. Shortly after his arrival at Dow Jones, Mr. Fenwick dismantled the executive suite and ordered managers to leave their offices, creating an open floor plan like that at Bloomberg.But it was the remodeling of Dow Jones’s business that proved his undoing. The floundering DJX business was highlighted in a study last November by Leigh Watson Healy, a media analyst at Outsell. Dow Jones’s traditional customers, said Ms. Healy, showed “resistance to both the new pricing and the new product.” She said there was an $11 million decrease in subscriptions from large Dow Jones customers. Ms. Healy’s study blamed a Dow Jones work force that was “untrained or unmotivated or incapable of executing on the mandate to migrate customers successfully,” and who were not equipped to explain “exponential price increases.” Customers told of the price increases, the report said, were told to “take it or leave it.” Though the news publications The Wall Street Journal and Barron’s are also part of the Dow Jones division, people inside the company said that Mr. Fenwick played a less active role in managing those businesses. News Corporation paid about $5 billion to acquire Dow Jones in 2007.While the decision to replace Mr. Fenwick came from Mr. Thomson and Mr. Singh, the chief financial officer, said the person with knowledge of internal discussions, both men consult frequently with Mr. Murdoch, known to take a keen interest in his newspaper businesses. “I’m not surprised,” said Alan Murray, a former deputy managing editor of The Journal, who had worked with Mr. Fenwick and is now president of the Pew Research Center.

            Ukraine’s Opposition Says Government Stirs Violence

    KIEV, Ukraine — As demonstrators in ski masks scuffled with the police here on Tuesday evening, opposition leaders accused the government of provoking the very violence it has been condemning in an effort to discredit and possibly split the protest movement.“The government tried to marginalize the protest, hoping that after 60 days in the cold people would become tired and leave, and only a different contingent would remain, only bums, but this did not work,” said Yuri Syrotyuk, a deputy head of the nationalist Svoboda party and a member of Parliament.“The government then decided to provoke a conflict, so some radical element would respond,” he added. “They wanted a schism. They are following the Roman principle of divide and conquer. This is their plan, but it will not work.”Opposition leaders say the government of President Viktor F. Yanukovich has also rebuffed all offers of negotiations, adding fuel to a volatile situation.“Few days are left, or maybe even hours, when solving the political process is possible through negotiations,” said Arseniy Yatsenyuk, a leader of the opposition Fatherland Party. “This should be done while people are still willing to listen to politicians and accept the path to political resolution of the crisis.”
            
        Opposition supporters moved a bus burned by protesters overnight to build a new barricade on Tuesday in Kiev. Sergei Grits/Associated PressThe government’s opponents said three recent actions had been intended to incite the more radical protesters and sow doubt in the minds of moderates: the passing of laws last week circumscribing the right of public assembly, the blocking of a protest march past the Parliament building on Sunday and the sending of cellphone messages on Tuesday to people standing in the vicinity of the fighting that said, “Dear subscriber, you are registered as a participant in a mass disturbance.”Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, blamed politicians from the European Union and the United States for encouraging the fighting over the past three days. The situation in the city, he warned, was “getting out of control.”“It seems someone is interested in this chaos,” Mr. Lavrov said Tuesday at a news conference in Moscow.He noted that American diplomats had said in December at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that the Ukrainian government should heed the opinion of the population and seek greater integration with Europe or risk instability. “What was this, prophecy or a prediction?” he said.The European Union issued no official response to Mr. Lavrov, but its officials say it has never condoned or encouraged violence, as Mr. Lavrov seemed to suggest it had done by having an official mingle with the protesters when they first turned out two months ago.At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, European foreign ministers released a final statement on Ukraine saying that “the E.U. remains committed to Ukraine’s political association and economic integration” with Europe “as soon as Ukraine is ready.”

Protest leaders said the authorities seemed to be giving the more radical protesters free rein while going out of their way to frighten more moderate ones, particularly with the threatening text messages sent on Tuesday.The phrasing of the message, about participating in a “mass disturbance,” echoed language in a new law making it a crime to participate in a protest deemed violent. The law took effect on Tuesday. And protesters were concerned that the government seemed to be using cutting-edge technology from the advertising industry to pinpoint people for political profiling.Three cellphone companies in Ukraine — Kyivstar, MTS and Life — denied that they had provided the location data to the government or had sent the text messages, the newspaper Ukrainskaya Pravda reported. Kyivstar suggested that it was instead the work of a “pirate” cellphone tower set up in the area. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The messages appeared to have little effect. Three hours after they were sent, riot police officers pushed past barricades of burned buses at that site and were met by a crowd of protesters in ski masks and bicycle helmets, carrying sticks and ready to fight.The police fired plastic bullets and threw stun grenades. They pressed as far as a cobblestone-throwing catapult built by protesters the day before and dismantled it before retreating.The opposition leaders who are members of parliamentary factions face a difficult choice over whether to embrace or denounce the more radical groups as the demonstrations grow more violent. So far, the politicians have condemned those fighting with the police as not representing the aspirations of the larger number of peaceful protesters who have gathered in Independence Square since November in support of closer economic integration with the European Union.

Genya Savilov/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesSome of those fighting the police, carrying baseball bats and throwing gasoline bombs say they are supporters of the European free-trade agreement whose rejection by Mr. Yanukovich set off the protests.But other groups have also appeared in Kiev, adding to the sense of chaos. Young men carrying sticks wandered side streets near the central square threatening to beat protesters who walked alone. One group shattered a shop window.The opposition leaders have said they believe that these people are soccer hooligans and unemployed men bused into Kiev by the government to provide a proxy force to intimidate protesters and darken the image of the movement by highlighting the violence.“Disorders should not be allowed to happen,” Vitali Klitschko, a former boxing champion and the leader of the political party Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform, wrote on Twitter. “This is a plan of authorities to introduce a state of emergency.”Early Tuesday, opposition activists detained about a dozen of these rival young men and marched them to one of several buildings occupied by protesters, where several admitted in videotaped conversations that they had been promised 200 hryvnia, or about $25, to cause trouble. But they were not able to explain clearly who had hired them.A civic activist who has been prominent in the movement, Ihor Lutsenko, was missing on Tuesday after men forced him into a car in the parking lot of a hospital, according to a Facebook post by his wife.The protests, which peaked in December, had seemed to be fading, but were re-energized by opposition to the new laws against public assembly.

            Kasparov’s Moves in Run for Chess Office Raise Ethical Concerns

    Garry Kasparov, the former chess world champion, announced in October that he was running for president of the World Chess Federation, the game’s governing body. He also announced a slate of candidates who were his nominees to lead the organization in various geographic regions. The nominees included Ignatius Leong in Asia, a surprising choice considering Leong, who lives in Singapore, is the general secretary of the federation under its longtime president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who is running for re-election. In effect, Leong was switching sides. The motivation might have been money.Two months earlier, Kasparov and Leong negotiated a deal in which Leong would help Kasparov’s presidential run in exchange for $500,000, according to a draft contract reviewed by The New York Times. Kasparov also agreed, after his election, to open a new federation office in Singapore, to be run by Leong, for which he would be paid an undisclosed amount. The contract was drafted by Morten Sand, a Norwegian lawyer working for Kasparov on his campaign. He confirmed its authenticity in an email to The Times and said the draft was superseded by another contract in which “the parties had agreed that all financial support was given with the explicit purpose of chess development and programs. No money was going to individuals.” Sand emphasized this point again on Tuesday in a letter posted on Kasparov’s election website after The Times inquired about the draft contract.

Kirill Kudryavtsev/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThe draft contract also said that in return for Leong’s support, the Kasparov Chess Foundation, which is based in New York, would pay the Asean Chess Academy, an organization founded and owned by Leong for teaching children, $250,000 a year for four years, beginning in 2013, though the agreement would be void if Kasparov was not elected.The Kasparov Chess Foundation also agreed to open an academy in Asia, in cooperation with Leong’s academy, in November 2013.Leong was to be “responsible for delivering 10 + 1 vote from his region, with the effort to deliver 15 votes (not counting China),” the draft contract said. Leong was also to “secure 5 + 1 endorsements (signed proxies)” for Mr. Kasparov’s election.Mig Greengard, a spokesman for Kasparov, declined to comment about the draft contract, but said the new agreement between Kasparov and Leong would be released on Friday. Leong could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.In the federation, each country, regardless of size or membership, has one vote. Voters can also designate others to vote for them through the use of proxies — a practice that Kasparov has criticized in the past, particularly in the last election, in 2010, when Anatoly Karpov, the former world champion and Kasparov’s former nemesis, ran against Ilyumzhinov. Kasparov assisted Karpov in his campaign.In that election, Ilyumzhinov, who has been president of the federation since 1995, defeated Karpov, 95 to 55. Much of Ilyumzhinov’s support came from Asia and Africa, and many votes were cast by proxies.When Kasparov announced his candidacy in October, he said that previous elections “were not transparent.” He also said, “I have resources that can help me to run a global campaign.”Among the members of Kasparov’s team running for office are Rex Sinquefield, a retired businessman from St. Louis who is Kasparov’s nominee to lead the federation’s organization in the Western Hemisphere. Sinquefield has become the biggest benefactor of chess in the United States in recent years, and has sponsored the United States Championship.Sheik Mohammed bin Ahmed al-Hamed of the United Arab Emirates, who owns a number of hotels and other real estate projects, is also a part of Kasparov’s proposed governing committee. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Charges of corruption, bribery and vote buying have been rumored in the federation for decades, ever since Ilyumzhinov’s predecessor, Florencio Campomanes, a Philippines chess official, was elected federation president in 1982. Campomanes was convicted by a Philippines court in 2003 of failing to account for how almost 13 million Philippine pesos (about $240,000) had been spent organizing the 1992 Chess Olympiad in Manila. The conviction was overturned after a higher court ruled that Philippines law did not apply to the federation, since it was based in Lausanne, Switzerland. Before Campomanes abruptly resigned as president in 1995, he helped get Ilyumzhinov elected.Ilyumzhinov was, by any measure, a strange choice. He was a businessman who was born in Kalmykia, an impoverished Russian republic on the Caspian Sea, and amassed a fortune after the fall of the Soviet Union, though exactly how and how much are something of a mystery. He was largely unknown within the chess world, though he had been elected president of Kalmykia in 1993, at age 31. He stepped down from that presidency in 2010.Ilyumzhinov is well known for his eccentricities. He has said that he believes the game was invented by extraterrestrials, and he claims to have been abducted by aliens in yellow spacesuits on the night of Sept. 17, 1997. He built Chess City, a huge glass dome surrounded by a housing development, in Kalmykia’s obscure and inaccessible capital, Elista, and had the federation hold championship tournaments there.In June 2011, at the height of the civil war in Libya, Ilyumzhinov appeared in Tripoli to meet with an old friend, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, ostensibly to discuss opportunities for developing chess programs in the country. The men played a game of chess for the cameras. It was the last time Qaddafi was seen alive in public before he was captured and killed four months later.In an interview in October, Ilyumzhinov said that he also visited President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in August 2012, after the civil war there had started, once again to ostensibly talk about chess development opportunities. Ilyumzhinov said that he did not believe that Assad’s regime had chemical weapons or had used them.Despite his oddities, Ilyumzhinov has had no trouble hanging on to the federation presidency.Maxim Dlugy, a businessman and former world junior champion, who assisted Karpov on his 2010 campaign but has no role in Kasparov’s campaign, said that he had been told by Alexey Orlov, Ilyumzhinov’s successor as president of Kalmykia, that Ilyumzhinov spent as much as $7 million courting voters in the 2010 election.For his part, Ilyumzhinov did not seem particularly upset by Leong’s defection. In the interview in October, he said: “I cannot say bad words against Leong. For me, it was not a big surprise.”

    Snowstorm Arrives on the East Coast

    New Yorkers are used to a lot of overheated discussion about impending snow.Storms get silly names, meteorological phenomena are dissected, and the airwaves are saturated with stories of people running out to buy shovels and salt.But the winter storm that swept up the East Coast on Tuesday, just after the long weekend for Martin Luther King’s Birthday, seemed to catch many by surprise, both for its timing and intensity.“I didn’t expect this at all,” said Mary Catherine Hughes, 22, who was standing near a subway entrance at Union Square holding an umbrella that was all but useless as wind whipped around her. “It’s horrible. Snow is cute for only a little bit.”The storm, which was expected to dump up to 14 inches of snow on the city by Wednesday morning, grounded thousands of flights in the region and made the commute home treacherous for millions of workers. At a news conference on Tuesday evening, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the storm had intensified since initial forecasts.

“People should stay home to the maximum extent possible,” he said. The mayor urged residents to avoid driving, in part to keep roads clear for workers. City officials said workers had been slow in plowing streets because the storm gathered strength just as people were leaving work.John J. Doherty, the commissioner of the Sanitation Department, characterized the roads during the evening rush as “not very good.”“It has been a slow response so far because we can’t move out there,” Mr. Doherty said at the news conference. He also warned people to expect “white roads” in the morning because salt was only minimally effective at temperatures this low and said it was impossible to clear streets to the blacktop by plowing alone.Responding to reports that no streets had been plowed on the Upper East Side, Mr. Doherty said a GPS device on one of salt spreaders had malfunctioned, leaving a false impression. He also said traffic had bottled up sanitation trucks.Mr. de Blasio said that as the snow tapers off, plows would be more effective.The Fire Department reported on Tuesday afternoon that about 100 callers to 911 had to be put on hold during a busy period. Salvatore Cassano, the department’s commissioner, said at the news conference that there were extra ambulances and dispatchers on duty to handle emergency calls, which had increased 25 percent to 30 percent. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority urged customers using the Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road to leave work early, warning that snow drifts as tall as two feet could cause significant delays.The storm’s impact stretched as far south as Washington, where the federal government was shut down. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who canceled his inaugural ball on Ellis Island because of the storm, declared a state of emergency, as did Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo for parts of New York. The National Weather Service issued its first winter storm alerts late Sunday and early Monday, but the path of the storm made it somewhat harder to forecast more than 24 to 36 hours in advance, said Lauren Nash, a meteorologist with the service.Many coastal storms, she said, originate off the coast of the Carolinas and trek northeast. This storm, however, originated farther north and therefore swept up the coast with less warning.Many schoolchildren were overjoyed to get word that their day would end early, even as their parents hurried to make alternative arrangements.In New York City, all after-school activities were canceled. Mr. de Blasio said the city would decide early Wednesday whether schools would open.Saul Vega, 38, a corrections officer who waiting outside Public School 41 in Greenwich Village to pick up his daughter, said he thought the school was caught by surprise. Just before the final bell rang, workers had not finished clearing a path for the children.“It is dangerous to cross the street with cars slipping and sliding,” he said. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The storm gathered in intensity as evening approached but was expected to dissipate around 3 a.m. Morning temperatures, however, were expected to be around 10 degrees, with wind chills that could make it feel as cold as negative 15 degrees. The frigid weather was expected to last through the weekend.Earlier on Tuesday Mr. de Blasio announced stepped-up efforts to reach out the city’s most vulnerable, including increased focus on homeless people. And he urged neighbors to look out for one another. “Just be careful about any kind of exposure in this kind of weather,” he said.When asked about scattered reports that the city had not been aggressive in preparing the streets before the storm — and complaints that some streets remained unplowed into the evening — Joseph Bruno, the director of the Office of Emergency Management, said it had not been “caught short.”He said that his office had been discussing the possibility of a storm for two days and that the Transportation Department had taken steps, like clearing catch basins, even before snow fell.As soon as the flakes started to fall, there were 450 trucks dispatched to spread salt on the streets, officials said. On Tuesday evening the snow was falling as fast as an inch per hour in places. Mohammad Khan, 50, a taxi driver, said he was scheduled to start driving at 4 p.m. but decided against it.“I’m not going to work until I know 99 percent of the road is clear,” he said, adding that the roads were dangerous. “If you don’t hit someone, someone will hit you.”The storm also caught people off guard in places as far-flung as Las Vegas. Rob Perez, 38, a writer and editor from Long Beach, N.Y., found himself stranded there after traveling to cover an adult-film convention last week.Holed up in a motel on Tuesday after his flight was canceled, Mr. Perez said he would not return to New York until Friday.There were worse fates, he said.“If you’re going to get stuck someplace,” he said, “it’s best to get stuck in Vegas.”

            2 Friends Reach Across the Aisle On Immigration

    WASHINGTON — The two women might at first seem more like political rivals than a reminder of the way things used to work in Washington.Esther Olavarria, a Democrat, left Cuba as a child, worked as Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s top immigration lawyer and now holds a post in the White House. Rebecca Tallent, a Republican, left suburban Arizona and became Senator John McCain’s chief of staff, briefly advised Sarah Palin in 2008 and is now a top policy aide to Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio.But if there is any way to unlock the immigration stalemate in Washington, colleagues say these two might find it.A decade ago, the two women spent months in marathon back-room deal-making sessions as they repeatedly tried to bring lawmakers together on overhauls that would have given legal status to immigrants, secured the border and opened the country to more legal workers. In the process, they formed a friendship that transcended party affiliation.

                        Boehner Is Said to Back Change on ImmigrationJAN. 1, 2014

    

                                    “What they have is superior knowledge of the subject that exceeds any other staffers and any members,” said Mark Salter, a veteran of immigration battles who served as chief of staff to Mr. McCain. “That gives them an advantage.”
            
        Rebecca Tallent, left, and Esther Olavarria. Richard A. Bloom/National Journal, left: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesOr as one longtime immigration lobbyist put it: “We hear from everybody that Boehner wants to get to yes but he doesn’t know how. So he hired Becky to find out.”Ms. Tallent, 34, is a key player in writing what Mr. Boehner and other House Republicans call guiding principles for an immigration overhaul. The goals, which are expected to be outlined in detail in the next week, are likely to include bolstered border security and enforcement inside the country, fast-track legalization for agricultural laborers, more visas for high-tech workers, and an opportunity for young immigrants who came to the country illegally as children to become American citizens.At the White House, Ms. Olavarria, 56, is charged with finding a compromise that Democrats and activists can live with. Both sides say they expect the two women to immerse themselves in back-channel talks, if they have not already.Ms. Tallent and Ms. Olavarria declined to be interviewed for this article.The two began working together on immigration in 2003, in the back rooms of Capitol Hill. Ms. Olavarria was the top immigration adviser to Mr. Kennedy, and Ms. Tallent held a similar position under Republican lawmakers, including Mr. McCain. The two senators had forged a bipartisan approach to immigration, and the women took their cues from what they had seen: an eagerness to fully engage — something missing from President Obama’s relationship with Mr. Boehner.“They understand how this works,” said Angela Kelley, a longtime immigration activist who has known both women for years. “They never deviated from standing by their boss. But they always treated each other with a lot of respect, and they never got to this point of personal breakdown where they couldn’t come back from it.”Today, the immigration landscape the women face is potentially more favorable. Mr. Obama is under intense pressure from Latinos who supported his candidacy to end mass deportations and offer a path to legal status to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. Many Republicans believe that if Mr. Boehner can find a way to overhaul the system, he may be the party’s best hope of repairing a deep breach with Hispanic voters in presidential elections.Others are skeptical about how much the two women can accomplish. Michael Torra, who worked as a legislative aide with Ms. Olavarria and Ms. Tallent in 2003, said their history of working together may not be enough to overcome opposition to a deal by Tea Party Republicans and immigration opponents.“Obviously, you need more than excellent staffers,” Mr. Torra said. “You need the political will from the people they work for.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Friends of both women say they have different styles but similar ambition and experience. Ms. Olavarria, known on Capitol Hill for holding an annual July 4 pig roast, is soft-spoken and even-keeled, while Ms. Tallent, a generation younger, is more animated. Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist who has worked with both, called them “hard-charging, low-profile, serious women.”Ms. Olavarria was raised in Miami, graduated from the University of Florida law school and spent the first part of her legal career representing Haitians and other immigrants. She later moved to Washington as an eager legal advocate, full of hope and energy.“I came here to change the 1996 immigration laws, and nothing has happened yet,” she said in 2005 as she and Ms. Tallent and other congressional staff members were taking a break from negotiations. The scene was captured in a series of documentary films called “How Democracy Works Now.”Sitting in a conference room that day in Mr. Kennedy’s warren of offices, Ms. Tallent laughed at how she had originally been interested in environmental issues, but stumbled into the immigration fight.The daughter of an Air Force pilot, Ms. Tallent was born in Del Rio, Tex., less than 10 miles from the border that would define much of her career. She was raised in Tucson and earned a political science degree from Carleton College in Minnesota before moving to Washington for Mr. McCain. She has also worked for Representative Jim Kolbe, another Arizona Republican, who fought unsuccessfully for an immigration overhaul.“My plan, actually, was to be out here for one year to answer some phones and then go back to Arizona,” Ms. Tallent said in the documentary. “It’s four years now.”For several intense months that year, she and Ms. Olavarria haggled over minute legislative details as the politicians grappled for support from business, labor and immigrant leaders. Deals were made and then crumbled as critics pounced from all directions. Ms. Olavarria was responsible for soothing the unions, while Ms. Tallent wooed the business community.The effort culminated that spring when Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McCain and a handful of House members announced landmark legislation to grant legal status to millions of immigrants, secure the border and increase the flow of legal workers. Happy but exhausted, Ms. Tallent and Ms. Olavarria and their colleagues savored the victory.“At some point next week, we should all get together and have a little celebration,” Ms. Tallent said to Ms. Olavarria and others.The festive atmosphere did not last long. The legislation they helped write in 2005 died amid partisan bickering in Congress the following year, as did similar efforts to reach a deal in 2007.Late last year, Ms. Olavarria and Ms. Tallent took a bipartisan trip to the New York Film Festival, where they joined about a half-dozen other congressional staff members and advocates in a small theater at Lincoln Center and watched themselves in the immigration documentary.“We were calling it old home week,” said Margaret Klessig Edmunds, who was chief of staff for Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, in 2005.Afterward, Ms. Tallent and Ms. Olavarria joined some of the others for drinks at a restaurant across from the theater. Ms. Edmunds said there was some ribbing between the two women, who asked each other, she said, “Aren’t you sorry you didn’t take that deal back then?”

            Ex-Governor of Virginia Is Indicted on Charges Over Loans and Gifts

        Former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia and his wife, Maureen, were indicted Tuesday. Steve Helber/Associated Press
            
            
                    
    

        

        
    Former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia and his wife, Maureen, were indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of accepting more than $140,000 in loans and gifts in exchange for promoting the business of a political patron who was seeking special favors from the state government.The 14-count indictment filed by the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia included charges of fraud and soliciting loans and gifts from Jonnie R. Williams Sr., the chief executive of Star Scientific, a maker of dietary supplements, who hoped to use the governor to promote his products.The indictment accuses the McDonnells of accepting some $135,000 in cash from Mr. Williams, thousands of dollars in golf outings, designer clothing and a Rolex watch engraved “71st Governor of Virginia” on the back. It accuses the former first couple of lying about the gifts on loan statements and to government investigators. Once a rising Republican star, mentioned as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney in 2012 and as an aspirant for his party’s 2016 presidential nomination, Mr. McDonnell has taken a spectacular fall since details of his relationship with Mr. Williams surfaced last spring. Under Virginia law, he was limited to one four-year term, but details of his relationship with Mr. Williams and the threat of his indictment colored the race to succeed him. “Today’s charges represent the Justice Department’s continued commitment to rooting out public corruption at all levels of government,” the acting assistant attorney general, Mythili Raman, said in a statement. “Ensuring that elected officials uphold the public’s trust is one of our most critical responsibilities.”At a news conference in Richmond on Tuesday night, Mr. McDonnell said he had been “falsely and wrongly accused” and that prosecutors had “stretched the law to its breaking point” to bring charges. He said he did no special favors for Mr. Williams. He appeared with his wife and took no questions.Earlier, a lawyer for Ms. McDonnell, William Burck, said she was innocent. Mr. McDonnell, who last summer announced that he was returning the gifts and loans, has long maintained that he never did anything for Mr. Williams or his company that he would not have done for any other Virginia business.He apologized in his last address to the General Assembly on Jan. 8 for the scandal, which cast a shadow over the campaign of the Republican candidate who sought to succeed him, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II. Mr. Cuccinelli lost in November to the current governor, Terry McAuliffe.A lawyer for Mr. Williams, Jerry W. Kilgore, declined to comment. Mr. Williams stepped down as chief executive of Star Scientific last month and the company changed its name.If convicted, the McDonnells could face decades in prison. As detailed in the 43-page indictment, Mr. Williams ingratiated himself with the McDonells by giving them lavish gifts and loans, many of which it said Ms. McDonnell solicited with the promise that she and the governor could help his company. Mr. Williams, an entrepreneur whose publicly traded company developed dietary supplements and cosmetics derived from a tobacco extract, sought to use the McDonnells to impress investors, as well as to enlist the governor’s support in winning state-funded research on his product.In April 2011, the government charges, Ms. McDonnell asked Mr. Williams to buy her an Oscar de la Renta gown in New York for a political event at the Union League Club. She promised to seat him next to the governor. Later that year, the indictment charges, Ms. McDonnell told Mr. Williams that she and her husband were having severe financial difficulties because of real estate investments in Virginia Beach. She asked for a $50,000 loan. Mr. Williams agreed to lend the money, telling the governor that “loan paperwork was not necessary,” according to the charges.  (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Shortly after, Mr. Williams paid $15,000 to cater the wedding of the McDonnells’ middle daughter, and Ms. McDonnell agreed to fly to Florida on Mr. Williams’s private jet to promote a dietary supplement called Anatabloc, made by Star Scientific. “Thanks so much for all your help with my family,” the governor wrote to Mr. Williams, in an email included in the indictment. “Your very generous gift to [CM] was most appreciated as well as the golf round tomorrow for the boys,” he added, with “CM” apparently a reference to the governor’s middle daughter.“Maureen is excited about the trip to fla to learn more about the products,” he added.At the governor’s request, according to the indictment, the Virginia secretary of health asked policy advisers to meet with Mr. Williams, who was interested in having Virginia’s public universities conduct scientific studies of the health benefits of the active ingredient in Anatabloc, which he would be able to point to for investors.In a meeting with the health policy adviser, Mr. Williams said he had discussed with the governor having the studies paid for by the State Tobacco Commission. Later, when the governor met with a top state official about ways to reduce health care costs, Mr. McDonnell pulled out some Anatabloc from his pocket, said he took it personally and asked the official to “reach out to the ‘Anatabloc people’ and meet with them,” according to the indictment. In the summer of 2011, when Mr. Williams offered a mountain lake home he owned to the McDonnells for a getaway, Ms. McDonnell asked if Mr. Williams’s Ferrari would be available for their use. Mr. Williams had an employee drive the car to the lake house for the McDonnells’ enjoyment, according to the indictment. The government charges that after Ms. McDonnell met with investigators in February 2013, she wrote a note to Mr. Williams trying to cover her tracks by making it appear that she had agreed to return the designer luxury goods to him rather than keep them. The governor was charged with routing Mr. Williams’s loans and other largess through family members and “corporate entities” to avoid revealing them on annual gift disclosure filings. When details of some of the gifts emerged publicly last year, Mr. McDonnell said they had been made to family members, not himself, and therefore he was not required to disclose them. Speaking to radio listeners last spring, Mr. McDonnell said, “I think it’s important that the people of Virginia know that nothing has been done with regard to my relationship with Mr. Williams or his company Star Scientific to give any kind of special benefits to him or his company.”Although Mr. McDonnell said he had returned all the gifts, the indictment includes a list of property that he and his wife would be required to forfeit if they are convicted. The list includes Mr. McDonnell’s silver Rolex, two gold Oscar de la Renta dresses, an Armani jacket and matching dresses, two pairs of Foot Joy golf shoes, a baby blue striped Peter Millar golf shirt, a Ping Kinloch golf bag, two sets of golf clubs, two iPhones and 30 boxes of Anatabloc.

    OXFORD, England — To compile a dictionary of nearly every word in the English language was an endeavor typical of Victorian times, complete with white-bearded gentlemen, utter confidence and an endearingly plodding pace. After a quarter-century, the first installment emerged in 1884. Its contents? “A to Ant.”In our own impatient age, the Oxford English Dictionary is touch-typing toward a third edition, with 619,000 words defined so far, online updates every three months and a perma-gush of digital data to sort through. Graybeards are scarce today at its open-plan office, just earnest editors frowning at flat screens, occasionally whispering to their neighbors. For all the words here, few are spoken aloud.This hush aside, change is afoot at the O.E.D. For the first time in 20 years, the venerable dictionary has a new chief editor, Michael Proffitt, who assumes the responsibility of retaining the vaunted traditions while ensuring relevance in an era of Googled definitions and text talk.

Andrew Testa for The New York TimesIn his first interview since assuming the position in November, Mr. Proffitt — a neat 48-year-old in suit and tie who has defined, researched and managed for the O.E.D. since 1989 — was respectful of the old ways but equally ready to reconsider the dictionary, characterizing it less as the heavy volumes of yore than as a trove of invaluable data.“My idea about dictionaries is that, in a way, their time has come,” he said. “People need filters much more than they did in the past.”“As much as I adhere to the O.E.D.’s public reputation,” he said, “I want proof that it is of value to people in terms of practical use.”Mr. Proffitt advocates links in digitized literature to O.E.D. entries; he wants more use by students, whose distinction between “dictionary” and “web search” is increasingly blurred; he is also willing to license O.E.D. data to other companies.The O.E.D. has stood apart, partly for authoritative definitions but chiefly for its unmatched historical quotations, which trace usage through time. The first edition, proposed in 1858 with completion expected in 10 years, was only finished 70 years later, in 1928. The second edition came out in 1989, at a length of 21,730 pages. Work on the third started in 1994, with hope of completion in 2005. That was off slightly — by about 32 years, according to the current guess of 2037.But for all the admirable rigor of the O.E.D., nowadays the dictionary is probably more revered than used. Part of the problem is price. A copy of the 20-volume second edition costs $995, with a one-year digital subscription running $295 — a hard sell when so many research tools are free online. (Oxford University Press does offer a less extensive cousin of the O.E.D. for nothing online, under the confusingly similar title Oxford Dictionaries.)Although the O.E.D. survived the Internet upheavals that devastated other reference works, it has yet to capitalize fully on the potential online audience. Mr. Proffitt is eager to do so, perhaps with lower prices, certainly with tweaks to the website and less stuffy definitions.“A lot of the first principles of the O.E.D. stand firm, but how it manifests has to change, and how it reaches people has to change,” said Mr. Proffitt, who speaks with a faint Scottish accent and a lexicographer’s habit of qualifying his speech with subheadings, historical references, alternate meanings. However, he is hardly the tweedy scholar of old, referring with satisfaction to having drafted the entry for “phat” (“a. Of a person, esp. a woman: sexy, attractive. b. Esp. of music: excellent, admirable; fashionable, ‘cool’ ”).Raised in Edinburgh, Mr. Proffitt moved south to attend the University of Oxford, where he studied English language and literature. After graduation, he floated from job to job for a spell, then spotted a newspaper ad: The O.E.D. was hiring. The editors who grilled him in his job interview later confessed that they’d not expected him to stay long.“But it drew me in,” Mr. Proffitt said 25 years later, now at the helm of an enterprise sharply different from the one he had joined.For all the tech talk, certain analog ways linger at the dictionary, notably in the Quotes Room, a repository of word citations on little slips of paper, many mailed in decades ago by volunteers around the world, the most prolific of whom are identified by their distinctive handwriting and referred to fondly by editors: “That’s a Laski,” or “This one’s from Collier in Australia.”In the 19th century, the primary obstacle to composing this envisaged dictionary of “every word occurring in the literature of the language it professes to illustrate” was tracking down suitable quotations, hidden as they were in myriad dusty tomes. Today, the editorial staff of about 70 people — with access to extensive digital archives — contends with the opposite problem: too much information.“We can hear everything that’s going on in the world of English for the last 500 years, and it’s deafening,” said the associate editor Peter Gilliver, who once spent nine months revising definitions for the word “run,” currently the longest single entry in the O.E.D.Literary texts accounted for most quotations in the early days of the dictionary. But the current text is far more inclusive, with blog and Twitter postings, quotations from gravestones, an inscription in a high school yearbook. The objective is to find the earliest and most illustrative uses of a word, not to grant benediction to anything as “proper English.” Each time commentators rebuke the O.E.D. for admitting teenage slang or marketing jargon, they misunderstand the dictionary, which aims not to define how language should be used, only how it is.This prompts a question: If the dictionary merely describes what exists, then why not include every word? When the O.E.D. needed to fit into printed volumes, that notion was fantasy. Now, when there is doubt that the third edition will even appear in print, why not use digital space to accommodate everything?The linguist and writer David Crystal appealed to his peers in a 2012 speech, later published, at the University of Glasgow to create a “superdictionary — the ultimate, unprecedented and, of course, unpublishable (on paper) collection of all the lexical items in a language.” This would mean combining major existing dictionaries and adding specialized lexicons, as well as words from global English dialects and new online vocabulary, too.Mr. Proffitt was reluctant to place the O.E.D. at the forefront of such a project. The dictionary, he said, lacks resources to transform itself this way. Instead, he advocates a federation of reference works. “The superdictionary may be, in fact, superdictionaries,” he said. “What you want is some kind of search that then sends you to the right place.”Simon Winchester, author of two books on the O.E.D., including the 1998 best seller “The Professor and the Madman,” expressed mixed feelings about the rapidly digitizing dictionary. He hoped, for example, that the third edition would someday come out in print, yet admitted to consulting only the online version now.“To me, I don’t want the joy of the O.E.D. and the authority that it has to be somehow overwhelmed by the searching abilities, the search engines and so forth,” he said.Mr. Proffitt, taking charge of the most esteemed record of the most global language, may face criticism however he acts. Some will complain if he brings change, others if he resists it. But years of working with words — meanings shifting, enlarging, vanishing altogether, joined by new coinages — offered a particular perspective. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “It makes you, broadly speaking, more tolerant or calmer or placid,” he said, hastening to add: “I don’t know whether those words are appropriate. But seeing the historical context often persuades you that what seemed like a hard-and-fast rule is not. And, similarly to the way the language changes, its uses change. The more flexible that people are about language use, then probably the more they thrive.”OMG, I Am, Like, Literally Unfriending YouTraditionalists lament the decline of the English language, but historical quotations in the Oxford English Dictionary show that many infamous terms of today are older than expected.

            Cuomo’s Pre-K Plans Set Up Tax Conflict With de Blasio

    Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday unveiled a budget plan containing a glittering prize for Mayor Bill de Blasio: money for the prekindergarten classes that he had made a centerpiece of his insurgent bid for mayor.Mr. de Blasio sent back a calm, but firm message: Not good enough.It was the latest twist in a battle that has captivated New York politics, with consequences that could reach far beyond the issue of childhood education, and a clear signal that the tension between the state’s two most powerful Democrats is not likely to abate any time soon.Mr. Cuomo, a centrist accustomed to governing by the art of the possible, is confronting a new challenge in the form of Mr. de Blasio, a staunch liberal who has channeled the impatience of a national left fed up with leaders who trade ideology for compromise.The mayor electrified liberals with his campaign promise to provide prekindergarten classes in New York City by raising taxes on wealthy residents. The governor, facing re-election in the fall, has repeatedly pledged to reduce taxes this year.
            
        Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday he still planned to tax the rich to pay for the program. Chester Higgins Jr./The New York TimesThe two men, whose relationship dates back to the Clinton administration, were widely expected to agree on a middle ground. But Mr. de Blasio rebuffed that approach on Tuesday when he said that Mr. Cuomo’s counteroffer — $1.5 billion over five years for a statewide program, but no tax surcharge — would not meet his needs.“The people in the city have given me a mission,” the mayor declared at a City Hall news conference, saying that the governor’s willingness to embrace a prekindergarten program was “encouraging,” but “different than what we intend to do.”A tax on the wealthy, Mr. de Blasio said, “was the No. 1 proposal I put forward in an election that I won with 73 percent of the vote.”Pausing for effect, he added, “I think the jury is in.”Such a rebuke to Mr. Cuomo is highly unusual in a state whose governor has long been seen as the unrivaled master of deal-making.But privately, aides to Mr. de Blasio say that the mayor is at a moment of maximum political capital. Democrats around the country have adopted his theme of income inequality. His poll numbers are still high. And Mr. Cuomo’s inclusion of prekindergarten — an under-the-radar issue before the mayoral race — in his budget was perceived as a sign that Mr. de Blasio was already driving policy priorities statewide.The governor, for his part, did not mention Mr. de Blasio by name in his budget address on Tuesday.But Mr. Cuomo took pains to portray his financial plan, which includes a number of tax relief initiatives, as a realistic one, unburdened by ideology — a clear rejoinder to his left-leaning, downstate rival.“Our tax package is not an advocacy statement,” Mr. Cuomo said in the speech. “It’s not a package that has been put together to provoke. It’s a package that has been put together to pass.”Those familiar with the governor’s thinking say Mr. Cuomo views the mayor’s plan as an inequitable one: If a prekindergarten program is paid for with tax revenue from the wealthy, then New York City could be at a distinct advantage over smaller and poorer municipalities around the state.And they contend that Mr. de Blasio’s stance is based more on politics than on principle. They argue that the mayor’s refusal to accept a deal without a tax on the wealthy shows that he is motivated by a desire to bolster his populist bona fides.New York has had universal prekindergarten on the books since 1997, but it has never been close to fully funded; recessions curtailed the program’s growth, and many local districts, which are required to pay for part of it themselves, never bothered.Besides expanding it, Mr. Cuomo said he also wanted to standardize the quality of prekindergarten across the state, describing the current offerings in some districts as only a “little bit more than babysitting.” (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio have spoken directly about the prekindergarten policy several times. But the gap between them has become more noticeable to people in state government, including the legislative leaders who will help determine the fate of Mr. de Blasio’s tax proposal. 
            Tax Cuts with Surplus Dollars        
                
            Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo expects revenues to increase faster than expenditures over the next few years, leaving enough money to cut taxes after paying for a new universal prekindergarten program. Here is a rundown of his proposed cuts, and how much they will cost.

“There is a schism within the Democrat Party,” said Dean G. Skelos, the leader of the State Senate Republicans. “Between the Democrat progressive left, and the Democrat progressive right; de Blasio and Cuomo.”Mr. Skelos said he had little appetite to approve a tax increase. The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, offered a more tempered view.“I’m open to funding pre-K, but I want to make sure it’s real, sustainable and recurring funding,” Mr. Silver, a Democrat, said on Tuesday, echoing the language used by Mr. de Blasio to argue for a dedicated tax to finance the plan.But Mr. Silver, who has said he is unsure if the tax can pass this year, added that the Legislature could work out a compromise that combined Mr. Cuomo’s funding plan with a smaller tax increase than what Mr. de Blasio asked for.The state budget must be approved by April 1, and the legislative session lasts into June, so there is ample time for the mayor and the governor to reach a solution.Still, Mr. de Blasio has wasted little time in taking his fight to Mr. Cuomo’s doorstep, mounting a campaign-style advocacy effort to promote his tax-the-rich plan with voters.Moments after Mr. Cuomo’s speech ended on Tuesday, allies of Mr. de Blasio distributed a note from the economist Jeffrey Sachs, chastising the governor for not endorsing a tax increase in New York City.Mr. Cuomo’s team did not provide any celebrity endorsements.The mayor and the governor are each approaching this issue with a unique political calculus.The mayor oversees a city with an overwhelmingly liberal electorate, and he has the benefit of a left-leaning City Council; its new leader is a longtime ally whose victory in becoming speaker Mr. de Blasio helped engineer.Mr. Cuomo is running for re-election across the entire state, with a far more conservative population north of the Tappan Zee Bridge. And the governor must do business with Republicans who have partial control of the State Senate, with a small group of independent Democrats, and are never eager to raise taxes.Aides to Mr. de Blasio say the mayor’s aggressive strategy, in part, is to ensure that prekindergarten programs receive as much funding as possible. Even if the tax is ultimately rejected by the Legislature, they say, Mr. de Blasio could obtain a better financial deal from the state and declare a partial victory.But the mayor was careful to avoid any hint of such possibilities on Tuesday, telling reporters, “I don’t bargain against myself.”Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime New York political operative, said the sparring over prekindergarten was a proxy for something larger: political supremacy. “Putting together an advocacy group is like telling the governor he’s not going to be allowed to do his job,” Mr. Sheinkopf said of Mr. de Blasio’s efforts. “It’s hard to see how this is about anything other than who is in charge.”

    BRUSSELS — Even as Russia imposes the most intensive security apparatus in Olympic history, the top military officers from the United States and Russia have opened discussions about using sophisticated American electronic equipment in a new effort to help secure the Winter Games in Sochi next month.The Russian delegation first raised the prospect of gaining access to the American technology, developed by the Pentagon to counter improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan and Iraq, Defense Department officials said on Tuesday. They emphasized that no decisions had been made yet.The potential for a technological exchange was part of an extensive discussion here on Tuesday, when Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held his first face-to-face meeting with his Russian counterpart, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, chief of the general staff.President Obama and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also discussed security at the Games in a phone conversation on Tuesday, Reuters reported. 
            
        Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov of Russia. RIA Novosti, via ReutersFew details were disclosed. General Dempsey said the Defense Department would be willing to provide equipment designed to detect and disrupt cellphone or radio signals used by militants to detonate improvised explosives from a distance. But he cautioned that technical experts from both nations first needed to make sure that the American systems could be integrated into the communications networks and security systems being set in place by Russia.In discussing the Pentagon’s technology to counter improvised explosives, General Dempsey noted that this was “something that we’ve become extraordinarily familiar with.” Homemade bombs planted by militants have been the leading cause of deaths and injuries to American service members in Afghanistan and Iraq.But the decision on whether to share the equipment is not a simple one. Especially during the early use of the technology, the American military found that it had created a muddle of electronic signals in which competing and overlapping systems canceled out the effectiveness of other systems in use at the same time and in the same area.“If you’re not careful, you can actually degrade capability, not enhance it,” General Dempsey said.During their meetings here, the American and Russian military chiefs sought to advance an agenda of exchanges and continued cooperation on counterterrorism and antipiracy operations, despite the fact that diplomatic relations between Washington and Moscow swing between caustic disagreement and cautious cooperation.Even with their extensive agenda on bilateral security issues, the question of safety at the Olympics was thoroughly discussed, including a description by General Gerasimov of the close cooperation between the Russian military and its civilian law enforcement and intelligence services to provide security for the Games.General Gerasimov described in detail how Russian authorities “have in place the intelligence apparatus as well as the response apparatus to deal with the threats,” General Dempsey said. Generals Dempsey and Gerasimov met one day after Pentagon officials disclosed that the United States European Command was drawing up plans to have two Navy warships in the Black Sea at the time of the Games, should they be needed in case of emergency.In addition to deploying tens of thousands of police officers and military reinforcements to the Sochi area, the Russian government has tightened control inside the city ahead of the opening of the Games on Feb. 7, banning vehicles that are not registered in the region and requiring even Russians who visit to register with the police within three days, as foreigners must do. The threat of terrorism has become a grim reality of major sporting events, and Russian officials are acutely aware that these Games are being held near a region festering with Islamist separatists. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Both the American and Russian generals — who share a history of having commanded large tank and armored units — emphasized the importance of improving communication between their armed forces.“I think we have an opportunity to advance the relationship on areas of common interest,” General Dempsey said.He noted in particular that Moscow remains a vital partner for supply lines for the NATO mission in Afghanistan, agreeing to allow the movement of nonlethal material to and from the war zone through Russian territory; that rail and road network is becoming increasingly important as protests in Pakistan choke efforts to use the more convenient supply line there.General Dempsey said his Russian counterpart was concerned about the potential for further instability in Afghanistan after the NATO combat mission there officially ends this year. General Gerasimov has asked for updates on the American and NATO effort to train, advise and equip Afghan National Security Forces, General Dempsey said, as well as Afghanistan’s ability to maintain and control transportation lines in and out of the country.“He is absolutely concerned, as I would be in his place,” General Dempsey said.In brief remarks welcoming General Dempsey to the Russian mission to NATO in suburban Brussels, General Gerasimov endorsed “regular contacts” between the militaries as “quite useful.” General Dempsey, in an interview, said it was important for the two militaries “not to foreclose on conversations, even if at some points there are disagreements that prevent the forward movement” in other parts of the relationship, whether political or diplomatic.

    Ezra Klein, an analyst, columnist and pundit who runs The Washington Post’s Wonkblog, will leave the newspaper, taking two of his colleagues with him, according to an internal memo sent on Tuesday.Mr. Klein is “looking to start his own news organization,” according to the memo, but his destination was not identified. He declined to comment on the matter when reached by email on Tuesday, but said he had not “signed anything with anyone.”He has been in talks with Vox Media, among other potential backers, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A spokeswoman for Vox did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.He leaves with Melissa Bell, director of platforms at The Post, according to the memo, and Dylan Matthews, who wrote for Wonkblog and started its more general sister blog, Know More.Mr. Klein, who joined The Post in 2009, quickly gained a following with a multiplatform blend of policy nuance and number-crunching on Wonkblog. He had been rebuffed in attempts to get The Post to back his venture, four people with knowledge of the negotiations said recently. He had been seeking an investment of eight figures, one of the people said.In the email Tuesday, Mr. Klein expressed gratitude to his former employer. “It’s an amazing place,” he wrote. “It’s been an incredible five years. I couldn’t be prouder or more grateful to have been an employee here.”The Post decided to make the announcement, said a person with knowledge of the internal discussions, to end the uncertainty caused by speculation about Mr. Klein’s future.Ms. Bell, said one of the people with knowledge of the move, is widely respected within The Post for her behind-the-scenes work toward ensuring Wonkblog moved at the speed of the Internet, rather than the more leisurely pace of a print newspaper.The content management systems Ms. Bell worked on — to move words, pictures and video quickly from the newsroom to the screens of readers — are unglamorous but considered vital as journalism converges with advances in the technology used to make and view it.The Washington Post also announced on Tuesday that it had entered a partnership with the Volokh Conspiracy, a legal blog run by a University of California, Los Angeles law professor, Eugene Volokh, and will offer its content as part of the newspaper’s website.

        Christie Sworn In for Second Term
        Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey took the oath of office at the War Memorial Theater in Trenton on Tuesday.
    
            
            
                    
    

        

        
    TRENTON — A subdued-looking Gov. Chris Christie, bedeviled by doubts about his leadership style and political tactics, took the oath of office on Tuesday at the lowest point in his governorship so far, determined to re-establish a bond with scandal-weary citizens of New Jersey and remind them of what it was they liked about him.Amid subpoenas, investigations and allegations, Mr. Christie seemed to plead with his state to return to the moment, just 77 days ago, when he was re-elected by a huge margin, luring the bipartisan coalition he described in his speech as “suburbanites and city dwellers, African-Americans and Latinos, women and men, doctors and teachers.” He spoke of “trust” and “faith” and “unity,” asking New Jerseyans to recall once more “the bond we have created with each other over the last four years.”Aides were determined to put a celebratory face on Mr. Christie’s awkwardly timed second inauguration, arranging for the traditional 19-gun salute and an orchestral rendition of the triumphal theme song to the Olympic Games.But Mr. Christie kept bumping up against rude reminders of his new reality. Inside the ornate War Memorial Theater near the State House, lawmakers and political hangers-on huddled in corners, shaking their heads and whispering about the scandal that has enveloped his administration. (“How could they be so shortsighted?” asked a man wearing an elephant pin on his lapel.) As he urged New Jersey to look to the future, Mr. Christie had little choice but to share a stage with the same Democratic lawmakers who have denounced his aides’ role in the imbroglio over the closing of lanes on the George Washington Bridge and unleashed an aggressive investigation into their conduct. Even Mr. Christie’s most cherished political mentor, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean, could not resist a jab, saying that he hoped Mr. Christie would learn something from the searing experience and wondering aloud to reporters if a national audience could ever learn to love the governor.“You can’t change who you are,” Mr. Kean warned. Throughout the ceremony, Mr. Christie, 51, known for a swagger and unapologetic belligerence, seemed transformed. He did not break a smile, instead pursing his lips somberly and waving his hand almost sheepishly, even as an auditorium packed with supporters gave him a long standing ovation. His wife rubbed his back reassuringly. His children gave him long hugs.Longtime supporters detected an unmistakable change.“It appears to have taken a toll on him, his personality,” said Dennis Calabrese, a contractor who came out to see the governor.Mr. Christie’s already low-key inaugural was muted by the arrival of a winter storm that forced the cancellation of an evening gala on Ellis Island, left scattered seats unfilled on the first floor of the theater, and prompted Mr. Christie to declare a state of emergency before his guests had finished filing out the door.Even as Mr. Christie tried to turn the page, the pressure escalated: On Tuesday morning, Democrats in the State Senate and the Assembly announced that they would merge their separate investigations into the conduct of his aides and his appointees at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. State Senator Loretta Weinberg, a leader of those inquiries, attended on Tuesday, and said that Mr. Christie and the Legislature would “have to find out how to work together” despite the controversy.“We’re all grown-ups here,” Ms. Weinberg added. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); In his remarks, Mr. Christie reached for similar sentiments. He did not once mention the bridge scandal, in which Christie loyalists shut down access lanes to the bridge in September, causing gridlock in Fort Lee, N.J., apparently as a form of political intimidation; in recent days his administration was accused of withholding money meant for Hurricane Sandy relief for political aims, claims it denies. Instead, Mr. Christie emphasized what he said was the cooperation and bipartisanship that had characterized New Jersey’s storm response and much of his first-term agenda. “Each one of these challenges has been met by a new, unified force in public life,” Mr. Christie declared: “A New Jersey setting the tone for an entire nation.”To highlight that theme, the Republican governor began his day at an African-American church in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, Newark, where the pastor, the Rev. Joe A. Carter, referred to the governor as “my friend” and made the day’s most overt reference to his troubles.“Everyone has to deal with dark times,” Pastor Carter said. “All of us at one time or another have to deal with times of testing and seasons of frustration.”In his address, Mr. Christie at times seemed to be speaking to a national audience. The speech reasserted Mr. Christie’s place as a nonpartisan, get-it-done governor, impatient with conventional politics and party labels.“We cannot fall victim to the attitude of Washington D.C.,” Mr. Christie said. “The attitude that says I am always right and you are always wrong. The attitude that puts everyone into a box they are not permitted to leave. The attitude that puts political wins ahead of policy agreements.” But unlike his widely watched keynote speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, which was mocked in some quarters for being overly self-referential and self-absorbed, Mr. Christie’s second inaugural address was conspicuously inclusive, more “us” and “we” than “I” and “me.”When his speech turned to schools and his insistence that “our government will lead the effort to create opportunity in New Jersey,” Mr. Christie paused, and slowly said the phrase “our government” three times.For many in attendance, the contrasts — a governor on stage with his inquisitors, pomp and celebration amid scandal and storm clouds — were hard to ignore. But for some seasoned politicians in the room, the incongruities felt familiar.“This is New Jersey,” Ms. Weinberg said.

            Man Arrested In the Killings Of His Wife And Children

    A man wanted in the stabbing deaths of his wife and two young daughters over the weekend has been arrested in Texas, the New York Police Department said on Tuesday.The man, identified as Miguel Mejia-Ramos, 28, was apprehended on Monday night on Interstate 10 in Schulenburg, midway between Houston and San Antonio, the police said. He was in a 2001 Chevrolet van with New York commercial license plates, the police said. Mr. Mejia-Ramos was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for stab wounds that did not appear life-threatening, the police said. It was not clear how he was injured nor was it clear when he would be brought back to New York to face charges. After the killings, the United States Marshals Service learned that Mr. Mejia-Ramos might be headed toward Mexico and sent messages and descriptions of him and his vehicle to law enforcement agencies along his possible routes, Kevin R. Kamrowski, a spokesman for the Marshals Service, said.A Texas state trooper spotted Mr. Mejia-Ramos’s van and was aided by members of the Schulenburg Police Department, the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office and the Marshals Service in making the arrest. As of Tuesday evening, he was being held in the Fayette County Jail. “It was a pretty quick little grab,” Alfredo Perez, another spokesman for the Marshals Service, said. “There was no drama.” The police had been searching for Mr. Mejia-Ramos since his wife, Deisy Garcia, 21, and their two daughters, a 1-year-old and a 2-year-old, were found dead in the bedroom of their home in Jamaica, Queens, on Sunday evening. All were stabbed multiple times, the police said. The children were found in their beds, and Ms. Garcia on the floor in a separate bedroom.The police have given no indication of a possible motive in the killings. Mabel Henriquez, a friend of Ms. Garcia, said she complained last fall that she had been abused, without providing details. And the police said that last year they responded to two domestic-violence calls at the family’s home on Sutphin Boulevard, though no arrests were made.Ms. Garcia, who danced with her church group and, according to her Facebook page, was a student at York College in Queens, and met Mr. Mejia-Ramos in the United States after she moved from Totonicapán, Guatemala. The family shared an apartment with her uncle and aunt and their two children, one of whom discovered the bodies.

    BANGKOK — The embattled government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra declared the imposition of emergency rule in Bangkok and surrounding areas on Tuesday, suggesting a more aggressive posture toward protesters who have occupied parts of the city during the past two months and are seeking to overthrow the government.But officials said they had no plans to crack down on protesters, who have escalated their campaign over the past week by blocking government offices, taking over major intersections and staging daily marches across Bangkok. The emergency decree enacted Tuesday gives the government the power to invoke curfews, censor the news media, disperse gatherings and use military force to “secure order.”Surapong Tovichakchaikul, Thailand’s foreign minister, said the move was necessary because protesters had broken the law by blocking government offices and banks in recent days and threatening and harassing government officials. The decree will “allow the democratic process and Thailand to move forward,” he said.
            
        Antigovernment protesters marched on Tuesday in Bangkok. Christophe Archambault/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesProtesters have been attacked by unknown assailants in recent days. Three grenade attacks left one person dead and dozens injured. The government and the protesters have blamed each other for those attacks.The emergency decree, which is valid for 60 days, was passed under the same law that a different government used in 2010 to start a military crackdown that left dozens of people dead. Underlining the seesaw power struggle that has gripped Thailand for the better part of the past eight years, the man responsible for the crackdown four years ago, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister, is now leading the antigovernment protests.“I know about this well,” Mr. Suthep said to his supporters, discussing the decree. He stepped down from power after his party lost a general election in 2011.“We will keep fighting until we win,” Mr. Suthep said, describing his protest movement as nonviolent and distinct from the “terrorists” who protested against him in 2010.Mr. Suthep, who faces murder charges related to the 2010 crackdown, renewed a threat late on Tuesday to shut down Thailand’s air traffic control office, but he also said he would rest on Wednesday for medical reasons.In recent weeks the government has been lauded by foreign governments, including the United States and European countries, for its restraint in handling the protests. The police have not tried to arrest Mr. Suthep despite a court-issued warrant for rebellion against the state.In addition to the emergency decree, the government on Tuesday put a combative government minister and former police officer, Chalerm Yubamrung, in charge of security.Mr. Suthep is trying to disrupt elections scheduled for Feb. 2 that Ms. Yingluck and her allies are considered almost certain to win. The opposition Democrat Party, which is allied with Mr. Suthep, is boycotting the election.In a country long plagued by corruption, protest leaders say Ms. Yingluck’s party has taken graft to a new level and is subverting democracy. Protesters are calling for an unelected “people’s council” to run the country and carry out political overhauls. The government says protesters are in the streets because they cannot win at the ballot box.The debilitating and complex power struggle in Thailand has put into question the future of Thai democracy. Ms. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, the founder of the most successful political movement in modern Thai history, have broad support in the north of the country. The protesters draw their support from Bangkok and the south. The powerful Thai military, which has staged a dozen coups in modern Thai history, is being courted by both sides.

    Fans of the Seattle Seahawks collectively call themselves the 12th Man, an extra player with a noise level so pounding at their home stadium that seismologists have recorded minor earthquakes during big plays.Fans of the Denver Broncos have a long reputation for noise that rattles visiting opponents, too, including a tradition of stamping their feet to create a rumbling called Rocky Mountain Thunder.Both franchises used the high-decibel help of their hometown crowds to help win conference championship games Sunday. But when their teams meet in the Super Bowl on Feb. 2 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., Seattle’s 12th Man and Denver’s Rocky Mountain Thunder will be mere echoes from distant time zones.

                                    The Super Bowl is where the National Football League’s famed fan noise goes to die. What the hundreds of millions of viewers around the world may not realize, from the comfort of couches in front of big-screen televisions with the volume turned high, is just how strangely quiet it can be at a Super Bowl game.
            
        The crowd at the Super Bowl game between the Giants and the Patriots in Indianapolis in 2012. Only 35 percent of Super Bowl tickets go to the teams playing. Jae C. Hong/Associated Press“There’s not a lot of crowd noise,” said Ron Jaworski, an ESPN analyst who was the quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles when they reached the Super Bowl at the end of the 1980 season. “People mostly sit on their hands, outside of the fans that buy the tickets for the team. It’s kind of a corporate get-together.”The difference in game-time atmosphere this season will be starker than usual, given the vocal support usually afforded the Seahawks and the Broncos and the location of the game, far on the other side of the country.The N.F.L. is the only major American professional sports league to play its championship at a neutral site. Although hosting a game can be a coup for a sponsoring city, such as New York, the effect is to neuter the energy level of the game itself.Only 35 percent of Super Bowl tickets are divided between the participating teams. For this year’s game, with a projected crowd of roughly 80,000, that means about 14,000 tickets for the Seahawks and 14,000 for the Broncos.The rest of the tickets are divvied among the N.F.L.’s other 30 teams (with a larger share for the co-hosting Jets and Giants), with about 25 percent of the tickets controlled by the N.F.L., largely sold and bartered through corporate sponsors and business partners.“It takes on the atmosphere of a game being played on a Hollywood soundstage,” the CBS broadcaster Jim Nantz said.The broadcaster Al Michaels has covered eight Super Bowls. The loudest he can recall was Super Bowl XLIII in Tampa, Fla., where Pittsburgh fans far outnumbered those of the Arizona Cardinals as the Steelers won with a last-minute touchdown pass.“Even then, you probably had half the fans there as neutral observers,” Michaels said. “I can’t think of a time where it would ever sound like it would sound in any other venue.”He added: “If the game is not very good, there is nothing. It might as well be played out in a park somewhere.”Even if hard-core fans pay huge sums for tickets on the secondary market, the fractured distribution means that the biggest plays of the Super Bowl are typically met with silent nonchalance or quiet frustration from the majority of fans in attendance.Gone are the wild audial and emotional swings of collective joy and disappointment familiar to N.F.L. fans through the regular season and the playoffs. At a Super Bowl, there is a continual din, each play cheered by some portion of the crowd, but no plays eliciting the full-throated roar of a complete stadium. It can be a surprising thing to witness — and hear — a Super Bowl in person, particularly after attending games in places like Seattle and Denver. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); At a Super Bowl, rare are the wasted timeouts and delay-of-game penalties spurred by deafening noise, which count as prizes for vociferous home crowds. During Seattle’s victory over San Francisco on Sunday, Fox periodically used an on-screen graphic to track the decibel level. In Denver, where the Broncos beat New England, the team’s first Super Bowl berth in 15 years was accompanied by a soundtrack of vocal support and foot-pounding thunder.“We couldn’t have done it without these fans,” Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning said. Like those in Seattle, most of those fans will have no such effect on the Super Bowl.Fifty years ago, the N.F.L. played its championship games at the home of one of the participants. The prospect of bad winter weather was an accepted component.That changed when the N.F.L. and the American Football League decided to pit their champions in a contest that came to be called the Super Bowl. The first game, in 1967, was at the Los Angeles Coliseum, in front of about 61,000 fans and tens of thousands of empty seats.Early games were rotated between California and Florida, mostly. The first 47 Super Bowls, in fact, were played in reliably warm weather or indoors at domed stadiums. This Super Bowl will be the first to be played outdoors in a region not noted for comfortable midwinter temperatures.Bad weather could numb the excitement, with hand claps deadened by mittens and voices muffled by scarves. It could keep people from attending at all, or chase them into the climate-controlled corporate suites and club-level cocoons.As luck would have it, neither of this year’s participants is particularly known for having a broad national following, in the vein of the Dallas Cowboys, the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Green Bay Packers. The driving distance from Seattle’s CenturyLink Field to MetLife Stadium is 2,853 miles, according to Google Maps. From Denver’s Sports Authority Field at Mile High, the distance to the Super Bowl is 1,773 miles.Fred Gaudelli, producer for NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” said the atmosphere at two of the Super Bowls he had produced was enhanced by the presence of fans of teams with loyal followings.“Steelers fans travel everywhere, and you had an entire section of them waving their Terrible Towels,” he said.“It’s going to be a challenge in New York,” he added. “It’s going to be a very corporate crowd. You wonder how many people will be in their seats, or in clubs, five minutes before the game staying warm.”It is a long way from home, and home field, and those who secure tickets (often sold for thousands of dollars) and make the trek will be greeted by tighter-than-usual, perhaps unfamiliar, restrictions for game-day frivolity. The authorities, for example, worried about traffic and security in the New York City area, will severely restrict tailgating, the pregame partying at big events.All that might be enough to keep faithful — and noisy — fans of the teams at home. As if another reason is needed, there is an increasing sense that football, as much as any sport, is a game best seen on a television or computer screen, given the appetite for replays, at-the-fingertips statistics and the comforts of home.It all raises the question of whether this might be among the quietest Super Bowls ever, a strange juxtaposition to the games Sunday that sent the teams to the championship game.Regardless, most Super Bowls end the same way. The clock expires, and security officers quickly steer the losing team off the field, cordoning it with ropes away from the celebration for the winners. A stage is hastily erected. Championship hats and shirts are distributed. Confetti falls or is shot from cannons. The public-address system blares a celebratory song from another era, maybe Kool & the Gang.It all disguises that there is little crowd noise. Most of the people have left. It is the Super Bowl, but it is nothing like home.

The opposition Democrat Party, which is allied with Mr. Suthep, is boycotting the election.In a country long plagued by corruption, protest leaders say Ms. Yingluck’s party has taken graft to a new level and is subverting democracy. Protesters are calling for an unelected “people’s council” to run the country and carry out political overhauls. The government says protesters are in the streets because they cannot win at the ballot box.The debilitating and complex power struggle in Thailand has put into question the future of Thai democracy. Ms. Yingluck and her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, the founder of the most successful political movement in modern Thai history, have broad support in the north of the country. The protesters draw their support from Bangkok and the south. The powerful Thai military, which has staged a dozen coups in modern Thai history, is being courted by both sides.

    LAS VEGAS — The sun had set on the Strip and some members of the Norwegian curling team were taking a break from competing in a tournament here. They were ready to hit the town, the Bellagio, perhaps, and maybe dinner at Caesars Palace. But the men knew that tourists would not recognize them as Scandinavian stars of an obscure sport.People cared more about their pants.In a scene straight out of a geekier version of “Ocean’s Eleven,” Thomas Ulsrud, the team’s skip, wore purple paisley pants with a matching jacket. Christoffer Svae opted for a tuxedo with a playing card pattern, and Haavard Vad Petersson wore bright pink cotton candy swirls with dots of electric green.Camera phones, laughter and the drunken exclamations of tourists followed the team as it traversed the dizzying casino carpet.“You would think in Vegas people have seen crazy stuff like that before,” Svae said. “But they got a lot of attention.”The curlers have gotten used to people paying attention to their clothes. In 2010, at the Vancouver Games, where the Norwegians won a silver medal, they made a splash when they made the sheet of curling ice their runway, competing in pants of bright red, white and blue, the colors of their country’s flag.
            
        The Norwegian curling team showed off their uniforms for 2014 on Tuesday. Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesThe pants came as a shock in a sport in which athletes traditionally wear black and draw little notice outside curling circles.But for the coming Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, the Norwegian team is back, and so are its pants.This year, there are at least two new pairs: one that’s a zigzag homage to Norway’s flag and one that’s black and flowery and could be called grandmother-chic.Days after the threads were unveiled in Vancouver, an unofficial Facebook page devoted to the team’s pants collected more than 500,000 likes. (That’s about a tenth of the population of Norway.)Representatives of Loudmouth, the company in Foster City, Calif., that made the pants, said orders out of London went up tenfold, and the company’s servers crashed.“It was enough to cause a stir in the curling world,” said Tony D’Orazio, a curler in Rochester, N.Y., who started the fan page and has chronicled the team’s fashion for the last four years. “For them to do what they did in 2010, it was revolutionary to curling. It took the traditions of the sport and re-energized it for a new generation.”And for the last year, designers and the team have been working on a highly anticipated line for Sochi.The designs were intended to be tributes to Norway, but they also had to look good on television, said Scott Woodworth, the founder of Loudmouth. The company made the team’s Vancouver pants and subsequently came on board as a sponsor.The designers avoided white so the pants would not be lost on the ice. But they did not want the plain black that has been a ubiquitous part of curlers’ gear for generations.

        After the Norwegian men’s curling team unveiled its new look for the Vancouver Games in 2010, other teams soon took notice.
    “They needed to be Norway colors,” Woodworth said. “They needed to look good and be striking.”The tradition of the colorful pants began as an accident.Svae was looking online for gear after a supplier shipped the wrong uniform to the team just weeks before pre-Olympic training. He found golf pants with a red, white and blue checkered pattern and ordered a set in his teammates’ sizes. (Previously, the pattern was mostly purchased by fans of the University of Mississippi Rebels.)“We didn’t really try to prove a point or anything,” Svae said. “It was just feeling comfortable with what we were wearing to represent our country. Obviously, it was a break from tradition.”At first, Svae’s teammates did not go for it.“I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I had seen,” Torger Nergaard said. But he did not think fans would care one way or the other. “As long as we were wearing pants, I didn’t think there would be too much of a fuss.”Four years later, the teammates say the pants improved their performance. Now they wear them in practice and in competitions.“It kind of took the edge off everything,” Svae said. “When our games were not going too well, we’d look at each other and think, Oh, you look like a clown. So it made us feel at ease.”Now, each player’s closet is a rainbow of 80 to 90 pairs of loud pants. They travel to each competition with about six options, usually coordinated by Svae. “My wife hates it,” Ulsrud said.There are rules to go with the pants. One is that they all wear the same pants together as a team, never alone.“These pants would be great to win in,” Vad Petersson said. “But they’d be terrible to lose in. We decided that when we wear them, we have to really try and win and go the whole way.”
